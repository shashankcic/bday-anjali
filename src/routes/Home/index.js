When I asked it (with dead reach becuase of inactivity), I thought noone would reply, but people RTed it, replied and everything. It just showed that howsoever much toxic the social or the real world can be, there will always be these nice humans who'll make it worth living.</h1>
        <h1 className='pa4 pt0 f3 lh-copy'>You are amazing Anjali, you've always been the best person, friend, everything I could've asked for. You deserve everything, I wish I could've done all this on your birthday (& especially before you received that book ðŸ˜‚), but was impossible without opening my laptop which I couldn't until yesterday (umar ho gayi ðŸ˜‚). If it weren't for these wishes toh I'd have waited for next bday, but these people matter, and you matter to every one of them.<br /><span className='b i'> Toh enjoy yeh year, Don't become predictable, Disappoint me in new ways. Baaki sab toh is Life.</span></h1>
